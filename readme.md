# Project 1:  PulseCheck App

Have you ever wanted a way to gauge your student's understanding quickly and efficiently? Do you like to give a **warmup activity** at the beginning of class? PulseCheck allows you to get immediate feedback with minimal setup.

Not a teacher? Not a problem. Certainly you would be able to find other uses for this app. You can get feedback from your employees, coworkers, or even your friends. If you want it to be anonymous, you could even have users sign up without using their real name. The possibilities are endless.

The administrator view gives you access to information about individual students, information about the entire classes responses to each question, as well as step-by step directions to use the website efficently.

As an administrator, you can view the question and see the breakdown of answers by the users. Teachers can project this onto the board at the beginning of class or anytime during the lesson that they want to check student understanding. It can even be used for an exit slip at the end of class. The immediate feedback provided by PulseCheck allows teachers to tailor their instruction or modify their lesson or unit plans.

Too many students answered the question incorrectly? Perhaps you need to review the topic a little more. Are many students choosing an answer that is close to the correct answer, but off by a little? Maybe you need to clarify edge cases with the class. Is everyone answering the question correctly? Perhaps you should pick up the pace a little. The power of immediate feedback when presenting material is immeasurable.

As a student, in the user view, you have fewer options, but that is the beauty of the app. It is designed to be responsive so students or other users will be able to log in with a computer, laptop, tablet, or even a cell phone. From the profile, users have access to the responses that they have given as well as access to answer any available unanswered questions.

Students answer whichever questions the teacher has selected, and then they have access to the results with a breakdown of answers that other students have selected. This helps students gauge where they stand in relation to their peers.
